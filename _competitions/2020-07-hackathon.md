description: "This is the project that my team and I built for the hackathon at HKUST 2019. This project features a Question-answering chatbot that can answer any general knowledge questions. We intended to build a chatbot that can focus on answering restaurant and food related questions but ultimately within the time we have, we were only able to build a general QA system. Nevertheless, this could be used as a generalization of any chatbot software. This repo contains the frontend website of the chatbot system."
