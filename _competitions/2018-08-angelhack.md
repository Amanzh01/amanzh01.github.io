description: "This is a project I built when I was participating in Angelhack Taipei 2018. My team and I were building an online security system that can allow people around to report problems about anything. We have two groups of clients: people who report about the incidents and the institutions or agencies that help to resolve those problems. We built a mobile app for people to report through pictures and descriptions, and a website for the institutions to retrieve those reports."
