award: "Top 10 Popularity Award"
description: "This is a microservice I made for our hackathon project at HackNTU 2017. We were building a web platform that helps the pharmacists to give the correct medicine to the patients using data retrieved from a huge medical database. Given that a patient has a certain disease, the online system will be able to deduce the most optimal medicine combinations through some data analysis. This will minimize or prevent doctor's mistakes, such as giving out certain medicines that will cause adverse side effects when used together. We eventually won Top 10 in Popularity out of 200+ international teams."

award: "Top 2 in Game Category"
description: "At HackNTU 2016, we built "Adventure," a mobile game. It is an image-recognition based RPG game that allows users to capture images of real-life objects that they will be able to convert into virtual useful items for their characters. We used cloud Azure services which gave us the technology for image recognition on portable devices. Among over 200+ international teams, we ultimately won the Top 2 Prize in Game Category (less than 15 teams received prizes) and 50,000 NTD in total."
