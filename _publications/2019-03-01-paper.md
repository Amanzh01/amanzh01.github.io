abstract: "Simplified Chinese to Traditional Chinese conversion is a common preprocessing step in Chinese NLP. However, a simplified Chinese character could correspond to multiple traditional characters, and unfortunately, there is no accurate toolkit to disambiguate such mappings. We propose a sub-word segmentation model which relies on Simplified Chinese and Traditional Chinese language models and the character mapping table. Through these two language models, we effectively segment a sentence and use them to disambiguate between mappings. Our experiments show that we achieve the disambiguation accuracy of 98%."
