I am currently a second year undergraduate student at the [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://www.ust.hk/home) studying Computer Science. While studying, I am also simulaneously working at the [Center of AI Research](https://caire.ust.hk/) supervised by [Prof. Pascale Fung](https://pascale.home.ece.ust.hk/). My research interests primarily lie in Natural Language Processing using deep learning approaches. 

Since high school, I was exposed to a wide variety of skills as I took part in various kinds of projects. I am skilled in building responsive websites, Android apps, and recently became interested in machine learning and deep learning. Check out my [Projects](/projects/) page to see what I contributed to before. Besides academics and research, I also have an entrepreneurial mindset, enjoy playing around with fashion, and modelling once in a while!
