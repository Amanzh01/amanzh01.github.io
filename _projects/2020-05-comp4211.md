description: "Research project for the course, Machine Learning, at HKUST. In this research, we conduct the Performance Analysis of Different Word Embeddings and Transformers on Fake News Detection. We compare between Word2Vec, GloVe, and Elmo; and also between BERT, ALBERT, and DistilBERT. We adopt three phases, each focusing on a different analyses of fake news detection: Phase 1 emphasized on comparing the performances of different embedding layers and transformers in a general setting, Phase 2 attempted to observe the capabilities of representative models under low-resource settings, and Phase 3 explored the possibility of transfer learning through pretraining of these representative models."
