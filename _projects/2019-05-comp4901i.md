description: "During my first year at HKUST, I studied Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing, which made me interested in this field. We learned about the modern technologies applied on text, such as word embeddings, CNN, RNN, seq2seq, self-attention, and even transformer models. The assignments of this course are as follows: Twitter sentiment analysis using Logistic Regression, Twitter sentiment analysis using CBOW embeddings and FeedForward Neural Network, Amazon product review rating classifier using word-based CNN, and Sherlock Holmes novel generation using RNN."
