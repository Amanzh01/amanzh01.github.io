description: "For any dataset of images, convolutional neural networks with different hyperparameters have different performances. Two algorithms that optimize the hyperparameters are Random Search and Tree-Structured Parzen Estimator. This paper is an investigation on the effectiveness of Random Search and Tree-Structured Parzen Estimator to optimize convolutional neural networks for image recognition."
