description: "This project is created while I was attending the Sydney | Hong Kong Ideation Exchange Program partnered between HKUST and the Macquarie University. The topic is about how to make the transportation, specifically the metro system, more sustainable in Sydney and Hong Kong according to the UN Sustainable Development Goals. Our idea was to provide a platform for the metro company to incorporate camera vision technology to their surveillance cameras already existing in the stations, to more effectively synchronize the trains between stations to minimize the waiting times for passengers."
