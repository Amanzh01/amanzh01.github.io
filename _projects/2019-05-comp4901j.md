description: "Research project for the course, Deep Learning in Computer Vision, at HKUST. In this work we use Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) with Faster R-CNN to create predictive fashion samples from the data collected from multiple sources of recent high-fashion catwalks. With sufficient amount of training, we found that the DCGAN model is able to output a set of images resembling a model walking on a catwalk with newly proposed patterns as the clothing design as our final product."
