description: "In this work we use Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) with Faster R-CNN to create predictive fashion sam- ples from the data collected from multiple sources of recent high-fashion catwalks. Faster R-CNN is trained with CUHKs DeepFashion dataset and aims to output whole body clothing items, consisting of either top (shirt) and bottom (pants/skirt) or a single piece dress. The cropping process in Faster R-CNN provides data cleansing (removal of unsuitable training images, such as an image of a single handbag) and a part of data preprocessing. This data is then relayed onto a Deep Convolutional-GAN to train both the generator and the discriminator. With sufficient amount of training, the DCGAN model is able to output a set of images resembling a model walking on a catwalk with newly proposed patterns as the clothing design as our final product."
